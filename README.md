 Healthcare Prediction System

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of common health conditions such as **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Liver Disease** using medical data. Built with Flask, this system empowers users to make informed health decisions through predictive analytics.

Features

- Predicts:
- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Liver Disease
- Interactive and responsive Flask-based web interface
- Real-time prediction using pre-trained ML models
- User-friendly input forms
- Model performance evaluated using standard metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Machine Learning Models

- Diabetes Prediction:  Random Forest Classifier
- Heart Disease Prediction: Random Forest Classifier  
- Liver Disease Prediction: Random Forest Classifier

All models are trained on publicly available datasets from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
